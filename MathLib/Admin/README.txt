each class and function library will have a corresponding error handler file and debugger file.  this way, it is easy for people with different error handling needs to customize error handling.  also, giving each class and function library its own debugger file makes it easier (read more organized) to make comprehensive testing and debugging code for everything.

eventually make GUI for easier debugging
fewest edges connecting two vertices
fastest way to send a message from a vertex to every other vertex
largest set of vertices not directly connected to each other
fewest edges connecting a vertex to all vertices directly connected to a target vertex
fastest way to find two distinct paths from one vertex to another which both are same length

c++ graph class
	adjacency matrix
		using vector of vectors?
			bounds safe
			practice using iterators
	memory safe
		practice with ctors/dtors
	make generic
		practice with templates
	operators
		practice with operator overloading
	robust against errors
		practice with exceptions
	persistence capabilities
		practice with file I/O
	search algorithms
		practice concurrency
		practice complexity analysis
		
can then be used to c++ test graphics engine project on
can be used to practice math and stats skills
	-math in implementation
	-stats in studying results of experiments on graphs

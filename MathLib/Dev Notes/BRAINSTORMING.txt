in order to ensure that nodes in a graph only link to nodes which are also in graph, maybe node class should be nested in graph class.  then a node can only be made through a graph and can be made to only connect to other nodes in that graph

should edges be represented as pointers to nodes which are found within a node?  Maybe for the

getNode(15)
	return nodeSet[15]
	
if (n.getID() == 15)

getID()
